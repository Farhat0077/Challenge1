Frontend web development involves creating the user interface and experience that users interact with directly in a web browser.
It employs languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure content, style elements, and add interactivity.
Frontend developers also focus on cross-browser compatibility and responsive design to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
